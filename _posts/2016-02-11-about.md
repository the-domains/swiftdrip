## About This Blog
![This should be your new mindset.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6e59025f-6d47-47b8-9287-bd3a65f93ad6.jpg)

My name is Leon, I'm a 22 year old iOS Developer and Marketing Specialist. And I like coffee --- a lot. So, here's the deal --- You promise to follow me on Twitter and Instagram, and I promise you to teach you the three most essential things to make sure you'll end up with an app that doesn't suck: 

* **1)**__How to combine design principles & swift to _make the world a better place_.
* **2)**__How to get into the mind of your customers.
* **3) **How to brew coffee that will drive you crazy (important for step 1 and 2 ðŸ˜‰ )

So yes, at the end, you should look like the guy on the top when you write code: You'll not only learn the basics of my design principles & code, but I'll also let you in on coffee brewing techniques that actually work. After all, life's too short to drink bad coffee or, for that matter, to write code that sucks. 

## Who IS this person?

Again, my name is Leon. 

Well...alright, here we go: I hold a Masters degree in International Marketing, a diploma in International Management & a BA in Business Management.

For the past years, I've been living in Hawaii, San Francisco, London and I'm currently living in Cologne where I'm building a startup that will **blow - your - mind!** Previous to what I'm doing right now, I did various strategy consulting projects for: 

* Two tech companies _in San Francisco_ (SEEK & Bouxtie)
* FMCG company (Unilever), SEO agency (GreenLight Ltd.) and a tech company (Lytespark) _in London _

Aaaand I've also been working as an intern and as a marketing assistant in the creative, trade and online marketing divisions of a global sporting goods brand (uvex).

## What's my startup?

I only just met you! I can't tell you that right now?!

...The truth is, we are working our asses off right now to make sure our alpha is ready until the end of April. Until then, sit tight, I'll keep you posted!

## Swift + Drip = ?...Ahhh!

Hopefully, by now you understand why I called this blog SwiftDrip. Right? I'm teaching you how to use the things you'll learn about Marketing, Design & Code in combination with what? Yes, how to make coffee that will make you gooooo crazyyy! 

Learning --- BIT by BIT, sip by sip...or in this case? ðŸ˜Š
